Description:
-----------------------

This application will allow a user to submit a job on the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) [Lonestar6 supercomputer](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/lonestar6) to visualize and analyze molecular structures utilizing the [University of California San Francisco (UCSF)](https://www.ucsf.edu/) [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) program.

Running the Application:
-----------------------
To run the application, the user must submit a job using the [University of Texas Research Cyberinfrastructure (UTRC) system](https://utrc.tacc.utexas.edu/). Once running, a virtual DCV session will be initialized for the user, and a button on the History/Jobs page will appear allowing the user to open the session. Additionally, a document titled 'ChimeraX_dcvserver.txt' will be created in the user's work folder with connection instructions. Once connected, the ChimeraX software will begin running, and a Tapis jobs archive folder will be created on the desktop for the user's convenience.
